# Setup

Make sure you have node version 22 installed (minor versions shouldn't matter). If you have a different version of node installed on your computer (check with `node --version`) consider using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install v22.

Install project dependencies with `npm install`.

To run the development server `npm run dev`.

## Additional

We use [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [this component library](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/) and [these icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/) which I've already installed in this project.


Make sure Node.js v22 installed:

`node --version`

```
nvm install 22
nvm use 22
```

Install dependencies
`nmp install`

Start the Development Server
npm run dev

Open the app in your browser:
